I-Patent: Secure Patent Filing with NFTs
This project explores the use of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to revolutionize the patent filing process.

Benefits:

Enhanced Security: NFTs provide a tamper-proof record of ownership and prevent unauthorized modifications to patent filings.
Streamlined Royalties: NFTs can automate royalty distribution to inventors and collaborators, eliminating disputes.
Reduced Fraud: The immutable nature of blockchain technology minimizes the risk of false claims during patent litigation.
Technology Stack:

Primarily written in JavaScript (percentage suggests this).
May also involve other languages like TypeScript (mentioned as a possibility) for stronger typing and code maintainability.
Front-end likely uses HTML and CSS for user interface development.
Getting Started:

Further Exploration:

This project provides a foundation for exploring the potential of NFTs in intellectual property management. Future iterations might consider:

Integration with existing patent filing systems
User authentication and access control features
Multi-chain compatibility for broader accessibility
